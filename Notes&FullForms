Vertical scaling - Vertical scaling is increasing the capacity (storage or computing) of single machine to support our data processing needs.

Horizontal scaling - Horizontal Scaling is instead of adding or increasing capacity(storage or computing) to single machine we connect another machine 
to existing machine & operating system in existing machine can use the resources in newly added machine. In this software / OS gives you the view as single system
although there are multiple machines underline.
There are many systems / processing systems which are horizontally scalable like - Hadoop,Teradata,MongoDB,Cassendra,GreenPlum,etc.

Latency- Time to get first record. Where user clicks the button & get the response. Critical for interactive systems.

Thruput-Number of records processed per unit of time.

If your goal is to process Huge Data then your goal is to increase the thruput. Means High number of records processed per unit of time.
If your goal is to have an highly interactive system then your goal should be to minimize latency of your system.

Goal of Hadoop is to process huge data hense hadoop can be used for batch processing where a delay in processing data is acceptable.
Goal of MongoDB or Cassendra is to provide low latency to the user hense MongoDB or Cassendra is preferred in backend of websites.
