-----------------------------------------------------Terms for Understanding---------------------------------------------------------------

Throughput - In general terms, throughput is the maximum rate of production or the maximum rate at which something can be processed.
Network Throughput -  rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel
Disk Throughput - Disk Performance Basics. Input/output operations per second or IOPS (IO/s), throughput (MB/s or MiB/s), and response time (ms) are the common performance measurements for storage devices, such disk drives or RAID sets.
